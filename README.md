# üì∫ Anushilon-Virtual-Science-Lab

ANUSIHLON is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The online lab is made for students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being rare or costly.

## üí° Motivation

Virtual labs are easy to set up, use and maintain, with notable reductions in cost and time. Experiments can also be repeated multiple times. This virtual lab has to be adopted in schools and colleges to make their students think out of the box.

## üì¶ Problem Statement

These are the problems I'm trying to solve. In our country, students are in the laboratory. They focus on writing test cases on their notes because they need to prepare a lab report of all experiments for their board practical examinations. Students do not focus on what they should learn and what scopes they can use in their experiments.

The major problem in rural areas is students cannot conduct experiments in village schools and colleges due to a lack of laboratory equipment and less funding.

In this pandemic situation, schools and colleges are off for over a year. Students study online with the help of e-learning platforms but cannot conduct lab experiments because online, there is no possibility to explore science lab experiments.

So the only solution to these kinds of problems is Virtual labs.

## üíé What and How I am trying to solve this problem

1. The main objective of developing a virtual science lab that supports flexible online, collaborative science experiments learning environment.

2. Where schools and college students can learn science experiments by simulation.

3. The experiments of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology subjects of class 9 - 12 in NCTB curriculum.

4. Also provide theory, procedure, pictures, video, animation, simulation, observation table, resources of every experiment.

5. Create a lab room where teachers can assign experiments, evaluation, and grading observations and see all the students‚Äô performance.

6. Also, students enroll in that lab room and submit that experiment observation. Students and Teachers both create posts and comments in the lab room.

7. Create a science e-learning community platform where students can ask their queries or doubts or share their experiences. Teachers or experts can answer their questions.

8. And create a monitoring panel for institutions to monitor their student‚Äôs performance and teachers‚Äô activity. Also, they can post a notice and arrange any workshops.

## üóÉÔ∏è How does this project impacts our society:

- It allows learners to learn through exciting, motivating activities to discover and solve problems systematically.

- Hands-on lab exercises in a flexible learning context and real-world problem-solving.

- It is helping to calculate their experiment results and record their experiment data in observation tables and generate results accuracy with graph view.

- Students are capable of experimenting as much as possible without barriers to tools, time, and place.

## üñºÔ∏è My contributions and the Project outcome.

- Utilizing a virtual lab provides students with the chance to develop critical thinking, innovation, and team working skills, all of which are highly valued in today's job market.

- Saving time and focusing more on their experiments and individualized practice in all areas of experimentation.

- The ability to perform, record, and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime.

- Helping them to understand the opportunities & scopes of what they can do more with their experiments.
